## Projects 
### Network Analysis of Top Influencers Using Twitter Data
[Code](https://github.com/mlcheah/portfolio/blob/main/project_code/network_analysis.ipynb)

In this project, I utilized Python's NetworkX library to deploy graph theory methodologies for a comprehensive analysis and visualization of influencer engagement networks extracted from a vast Twitter dataset. This involved constructing and examining network graphs to uncover the intricacies of communication flows and influence patterns among key stakeholders in the digital space. By mapping these interactions, the project shed light on the structural dynamics of social media influence, highlighting central nodes and pathways of information dissemination.

### Influencer Sentiment Impact on Followers: A Causal Inference Analysis Using Instrumental Variables
[Code] 

This project investigates the causal effect of top influencers' sentiments on their followers' sentiments on Twitter, employing an instrumental variable strategy to address endogeneity issues. By quantitatively measuring tweet sentiments, the study rigorously examines the directional influence of key opinion leaders on the sentiment dynamics within their engagement networks. This approach not only advances our understanding of social media influence mechanisms but also demonstrates the application of econometric methods in deciphering complex, causal relationships in social media platforms.

### Analyzing Real Estate Market Dynamics through Social Media Narratives: A Data Science Approach with LDA Modeling
[Code] To be published soon

This project delves into the influence of social media narratives on real estate prices, employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling to dissect and understand the thematic structures within vast amounts of Twitter data
