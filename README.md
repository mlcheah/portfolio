## Projects 
### Network Analysis of Top Influencers Using Twitter Data
[Code](https://github.com/mlcheah/portfolio/blob/main/project_code/network_analysis.ipynb)

In this project, I utilized Python's NetworkX library to deploy graph theory methodologies for a comprehensive analysis and visualization of influencer engagement networks extracted from 1.2 million real-estate related Tweets. This involved constructing and examining network graphs to reveal communication patterns among top influencers on Twitter. By mapping these interactions, the project sheds light on the structural dynamics of social media influence. 

### Analyzing Real Estate Market Dynamics through Social Media Narratives: A Data Science Approach with BERTopic Modeling
[Code] To be published soon

This project delves into the influence of social media narratives on real estate prices, employing BERTopic and LDA topic modeling to dissect and understand the thematic structures within 5.8 million Tweets related to real estate.

### Influencer Sentiment Impact on Followers and Housing Market: A Causal Inference Analysis Using Instrumental Variables
[Code] 

This project explores the causal relationship between top Twitter influencers' sentiments and their impact on follower sentiments in the real estate sector, utilizing an instrumental variable approach to mitigate endogeneity. By quantitatively measuring tweet sentiments using VADER, the study examines the directional influence of top influencers on the sentiment of their engaged connections. My analysis demonstrated a clear linkage: sentiments of top influencers significantly affect their followers' sentiments, which in turn impacts housing market prices. This finding highlights the substantial influence of digital discourse on real estate trends.

### Quantifying the Impact of Economic Changes on Migration Patterns: A Panel VAR Approach
[Slides](https://github.com/mlcheah/portfolio/blob/main/project_code/panelVAR_project.pdf)

In this project, I applied a second-order Panel VAR model to examine the relationship between immigration and economic indicators, such as GDP per capita and unemployment rates, across nine host countries using data from 1991-2011. Utilizing advanced econometric techniques, including Helmert procedure and GMM estimation, I addressed non-stationarity issues and isolated the effects of economic variables on migration flows. The findings highlight the sensitivity of migration patterns to economic conditions, offering insights into the causal dynamics between host country economic states and immigration trends.
